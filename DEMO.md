### Script Outline

**Opening:**
"Hello! Today I'm presenting the Universal FHEVM SDK, built for the Zama bounty. This SDK makes building confidential dApps simple and framework-agnostic."

**Architecture:**
"The SDK is built in layers - a framework-independent core, with adapters for React, Next.js, and other frameworks. This wagmi-like structure will be familiar to web3 developers."

**Setup:**
"Getting started is incredibly simple. Just npm install from the root, and you have everything you need. Let me show you..."

**Examples:**
"Here's our Next.js example. Watch as I connect my wallet, encrypt a value, and decrypt it with my signature. Notice how clean the API is - just a few lines of code."

**Closing:**
"This SDK covers the complete FHEVM flow - initialization, encryption, decryption, and contract interaction - all in a reusable, type-safe package. Thank you!"

## Tips for Great Demo

✅ **Do:**
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Show working features live
- Explain code as you write/show it
- Highlight innovative aspects
- Demonstrate multiple frameworks
- Show <10 lines setup

❌ **Don't:**
- Rush through explanations
- Skip error handling
- Use too much jargon
- Forget to show results
- Neglect audio quality

## Evaluation Points Addressed

The demo should clearly show:

1. **Usability** - Quick install and minimal setup
2. **Completeness** - Full FHEVM flow coverage
3. **Reusability** - Framework-agnostic design
4. **Documentation** - Clear README and examples
5. **Creativity** - Multiple environments and use cases
